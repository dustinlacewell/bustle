# Community Mod Lists

One of the `bustle workshop` commands is `list`. It has its own subcommands for interacting with community mod lists:

```
bustle workshop list <subcommand>
> Community mod list commands

where <subcommand> can be one of:

- index - Get the index of community mod lists
- get - Get info on a mod list
- sub - Subscribe to the mods in a community list
- unsub - Unsubscribe from one or more mods
```

This is a brief overview of the mod list commands. For more information, use `bustle workshop list <subcommand> --help`.

## Where do the community mod lists come from?

The community lists are managed on GitHub at [Bustle Community Lists](https://github.com/dustinlacewell/bustle-community-lists) repo.

Discussions around what lists should exist, and which mods should be in them, take place in the [Bustle Modding Discord](https://discord.gg/bustlemodding) and the issues on the [bustle-community-lists](https://github.com/dustinlacewell/bustle-community-lists/issues).
